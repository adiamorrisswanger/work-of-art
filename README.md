### What I learned
During this project I learned how to customize bootstraps pre-set css classes. I was challened to make their genertic nav bar into one that fit the color scheme and design of the website. I also learned how to impliment a "to the top" button in order to bring viewers to the top of a long landing page. For this button I had to combind my prior CSS skills with JavaScript functions.
